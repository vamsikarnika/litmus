## Branching Strategy
- `feature/dev` is always our base branch and it should be upto date.
- Say you want to work on some new feature for example: authentication
- Now you create a branch `feature/authentication` from our base branch `feature/dev`, work on your changes there.
- And then you raise a pull request form your branch aka `feature/authentication` into our base branch aka `feature/dev`
- After it is merged, you can now dispose your branch if you like to.
